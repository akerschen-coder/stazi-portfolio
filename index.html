                <p class="p-font">I was born and raised in Colorado, falling in love with the moutains
                I got older. Going to Front Range Community College for my Associates in 
                biology and communication before heading to Colorado University of Denver 
                to finish my degree. Only to be discouraged and looking for a new career path 
                when I found coding. It only took one free online class for me to fall in love
                with solving the puzzle of making a website. Currently enrolled in a bootcamp 
                at CU Denver where I will get my certificate of completeion for being a full stack
                developer. 
                </p>

                <p class="p-font">
                    While my experience of being a coder is small, I bring in a lot from my other jobs. 
                    Currently I work as a swim instructor to kids ages 5 months to 13 years old. As 
                    anyone would guess, it takes a lot of patience and encouragement. Being able to 
                    have patience with a code and willing to look through everything is a blessing in disguise. 
                    Another one was my jobs was at a methadone clinic, one that was high risk at times. 
                    It put me in positions where I would have to come up with results, explnations and more 
                    on the spot.

                    One thing that I believe is super important is a work life balance. I have multiple 
                    hobbies, as everyone does, including rockclimbing, aerial lyra and recently rollarskating.
                    I bring this up because I believe everyone should have a work-life balance and in doing so 
                    make it a point to work with team members to create a fast moving but healthy 
                    work enviroment that is productive as all memebers are relaxed.
