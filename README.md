## Description 
- Nav bar links to correct area

- Motivation for this project was to get better at designing CSS and learning how to connect html to css. 

## Problems Solved 
Throughout this activity, the main area I sturggled with is connecteing the html and css classes together perfect. 
Learning about divs, how to set correct containers and flexbox. In the future I will learn how to correctly put the two together,
hopefully in a more organized way with less classes that can be applied more containers. 
p.s check out the spotify link I put in there.
